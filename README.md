# 🛠️ Clean RESTful API with ASP.NET Core

Welcome to my RESTful API project built using **ASP.NET Core** — a clean, maintainable, and scalable backend service developed as part of my upskilling journey. This API was implemented by following industry best practices and the guide by [Evandro Gomes](https://dev.to/evandrogomes/an-awesome-guide-on-how-to-build-restful-apis-with-aspnet-core-4hnp).

> 🚀 This project demonstrates my understanding of building real-world APIs using modern C# and .NET Core frameworks, and reflects my capabilities in backend development, database integration, and API testing.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This RESTful API simulates a real-world application scenario where client applications interact with centralized backend services to manage and access data. The solution follows **Clean Architecture** principles, ensuring that code is well-structured and easy to maintain.

### 🔧 Tech Stack
- **.NET Core 2.2**
- **ASP.NET Core Web API**
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **AutoMapper**
- **PostgreSQL** (or your choice of RDBMS)
- **Postman** (for API testing)
- **Visual Studio Code** (or any preferred IDE)

---

## 📁 Features

- ✅ Clean and maintainable API structure
- ✅ Layered architecture (Controllers, Services, Repositories)
- ✅ DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) with AutoMapper
- ✅ Full CRUD operations
- ✅ Error handling and validations
- ✅ Postman Collection for API testing
- ✅ Git version control and best commit practices

📬 API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/api/resource	Get all items
GET	/api/resource/{id}	Get item by ID
POST	/api/resource	Create new item
PUT	/api/resource/{id}	Update item
DELETE	/api/resource/{id}	Delete item

🔄 Replace resource with your actual entity, such as users, products, etc.
